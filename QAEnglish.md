## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: What should I do if my login cannot connect to the server?
A: Please check if the port is open. It is recommended to set the public IP server to `0.0.0.0`.

### Q: Is this program highly secure?
A: If you are using my program for security reasons, it is recommended to avoid using it. A program that verifies Excel files through web authentication cannot be said to be as solid as a rock, but it can only be said to be comparable to the Maginot Line. If your target is aimed at users who do not know programming languages, then this program is a good choice.

### Q: Is there a way I can improve security?
A: You can try changing xlsx to SQL, modifying return codes, or encrypting the entire program.

### Q: Why does my Generated By key display as `{true}`?
A: It is very likely that a vulnerability in this program was discovered by your user. They created a Key in this way because a normally created Key would only display `{backend}`. If this happens, please send me the log file.
